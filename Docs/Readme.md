In the description of this project, it was required to implement a seperate class which will serve as generator of cryptographically strong random key. But, this feature was not implemented in this project. Since: 

- class ```HMACSHA512``` generates such key every time new instance of this class is initialized and stores it inside of the ```.Key``` property.


Hope it will not affect the grading of this implementation. I will look forward to hearing about feedback of this project
